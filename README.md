# Grok Exporter

## Overview
Grok Exporter is a web application designed to manage and visualize chat data stored in Chrome extension storage. It presents chat entries as a grid of interactive tiles, each displaying a title and a preview of the conversation content. 
Users can click a tile to view the full conversation in an expanded viewer, with options to perform operations such as editing or deleting entries. 


## Features
- **Tile Grid Display**: View all chat entries as a responsive grid, with each tile showing the chat title and a 200-character content preview.
- **Expanded Viewer**: Click a tile to access a detailed view of the conversation, rendered in a preformatted block for readability.
- **Interactive Operations**: Perform actions like editing or deleting chat entries directly from the viewer (delete operation removes entries from Chrome storage).
- **Theming**: Dark, GitHub-inspired design with smooth hover effects, subtle shadows, and blue/red accents for interactive elements.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes using a flexible grid layout.
